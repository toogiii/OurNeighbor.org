The NEXT CHAPTER BOOKSTORE is not your typical used bookstore. The main goal of this independent shop is to provide jobs and social interaction for adults with disabilities, as well as train the community about perception.
  <br><br>
D'ete Sewell, owner of the former Ralph Waldo's Vintage Books, decided to create a workplace for the residents of Our Neighbor Inc., and her expertise was in books. After searching for a retail space for quite some time, the owners of Main Street Market provided the ideal location, which is in the heart of the historic downtown square in Gainesville, Georgia.
  <br><br>
A booklovers dream, this establishment has plenty to offer.The store is loaded with used books of all genre, all at greatly discounted prices made possible from generous donations by the citizens and businesses of the local area. You may also find DVD's, CD's, old prints and sheetmusic, as well as "recycled" journals and birdhouses made from old book covers.
  <br><br>
Come in, sit down with a book or just chat with one of the employees. If you're looking for high quality and personal service, you've come to the right place.
