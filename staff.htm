	her best talent given from God is the ability to listen to others when they need to talk. Her traits include: caring, loving

	for disabled as well as she was already a caregiver to a resident moving in to ONI. Her favorite things about her job is: 
	seeing the smiles on the residents and the employees faces when they come to work. she also loves the generous nature of the

</div>My name is Renee and is also a Next Chapter Bookstore Manager. I enjoy fishing, reading, working out at the gym, 
running/walking 5ks, and horseback riding; in fact, I collect anything horse related. I also collect 
crosses with bible verses.  I have Cerebral Palsy in the right side of my body, along with a speech 
impairment. I am a very easy-going, flexible, and dependable individual. I like working at NCB because 
I enjoy the computer-work, as well as the people whom I connect with, and of course, books.

My name is Judy, and I am a “volunteer staff member” at NCB. I enjoy reading, games, gardening, crafting, 
cooking, and antiquing (I collect antiques, so this one is especially fun for me). I had a brain aneurism 
a while ago, which causes me some memory loss. I like volunteering at NCB because it gives me a sense of 
helping others. I am very caring, a good listener, and love to share. I am also responsible for making the 
custom-order journals and birdhouses here.

My name is Dhiren. I enjoy Special Olympics, swimming, sports, cleaning/organizing, cooking, playing video 
games, drawing, exercising, watching DVDs, bible study, reading, and adding to my collection of DC comic 
books.  I am accommodating when it comes to people who cannot do as much as I can, a perfectionist when 
it comes to work and getting things done, and compassionate toward both two and four legged creatures 
(I volunteer at the animal shelter occasionally). I like working at NCB because it is a good opportunity 
to help in the community and give back. Also, D’ete is a GREAT boss; she makes me smile every time I walk 
into the bookstore – even when she is not there, someone is always there to help me out. In addition, I 
like talking to and helping customers.

My name is Shawn. I enjoy bowling, weightlifting, and helping out on my family's farm whenever I get the chance. I am very strong, 
funny, and a real gentleman. I have a low reading level; however, that does not stop me from collecting Goosebumps books. I like 
living at ONI because it helps me learn how to go places on my own. Shawn is the "muscle"" for the book store. <BR><BR> <BR><BR><BR><BR> </p>

<div align="right">B I L L Y</div>My name is Billy. I enjoy participating in Special Olympics, hanging
 out with friends, and riding the bus – 
particularly to the mall. I was born with a learning disability that followed me through high school 
(I graduated with a special education diploma); but now, I seem to have outgrown it. I am very polite, 
supportive, and easy to get along with. It is fun for me to work at NCB and to be able to learn some life 
skills. Also, the management and other staff here are the best.

of Pokémon and Mario paraphernalia. I am very friendly and compassionate toward both two and four-legged 
creatures. I am also a hard-worker. I have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, and like working at NCB because it 
gives me a chance to make my mom proud of me. Plus, I like telling the public how NCB is a GREAT 
bookstore to come and/or donate to.<BR><BR><BR><BR> <BR><BR></p>

and friends, playing with my dogs, and reading. I also love ANYTHING that has to do with fashion 
(particularly purses and handbags; although I do not collect them.). I have a tumor in the back of my 
brain and get severe migraines, and am short for my age. Despite my difficulties, I am a very creative, 
fun-loving, and laid back young lady. I like working at NCB because I like the atmosphere and the 
people. Plus, I LOVE books.
