My name is Shawn. I enjoy bowling, weightlifting, and helping out on my family's farm whenever I get the chance. I am very strong, 
funny, and a real gentleman. I have a low reading level; however, that does not stop me from collecting Goosebumps books. I like 
living at ONI because it helps me learn how to go places on my own. Shawn is the "muscle"" for the book store.

My name is Dhiren. I enjoy Special Olympics, swimming, sports, cleaning/organizing, cooking, playing video games, drawing, exercising, 
watching DVDs, bible study, reading, and adding to my collection of DC comic books.  I am accommodating when it comes to people who 
cannot do as much as I can, a perfectionist when it comes to work and getting things done, and compassionate toward both two and four 
legged creatures (I volunteer at the animal shelter occasionally). I like living at ONI because I can live independently, and it gives 
me an opportunity to grow and develop more independent living skills.<BR>

 <p align="left" style="font-size: 14pt">
  My name is Billy. I enjoy participating in Special Olympics, hanging out with friends, and riding the bus - particularly to the mall. I was 
 born with a learning disability that followed me through high school (I graduated with a special education diploma); but now, I seem to 
 have outgrown it. I am very polite, supportive, and easy to get along with. I like living at ONI because it is almost like a great big family. I can
 speak to anyone if I have a problem, and the group is very encouraging to me.

My name is Emilie. I was born on December 10th 1991, and I have a disease called Mitochondrial Disease (commonly referred to as "Mito"), 
which is a progressively degenerative disorder that affects the mitochondria in the body. I also have a hyperkinetic movement disorder, 
some speech issues, and OCD. Since October 2014, as a creative outlet for my OCD, I have been making real-time lyric videos of my favorite 
music genre - Christian rock - and uploading them to YouTube (If you want to check them out, <strong><em>https://www.you<br />tube.com/playlist?<br />list=PLZZcwoGbN<br />KOKLnLUqCcNHmm<br />2pd30jQqAb;</em></strong> oh, and make sure and read the description, as well). In addition to                              
my video-making, I enjoy watching NCIS (My favorite show) on Tuesday evenings, going to worship, shopping - for ANYTHING, listening to 
music on my iPod, and computer games and social media. I collect shot glasses (though I do not drink), cookbooks (though I do not cook 
or bake), Point of Grace CDs, old coins, and I have just started a collection of postcards of places that I have been (since people bring 
back shot glasses for me when they go places). I am stubborn as a mule, very smart, and quite observant. 
I like living at ONI than at my parents' place in South Carolina. 
I enjoy being able to be as independent as possible. Although, I do like going up to visit my parents.

Leanna lives with the three ladies at the Ladies house at Our Neighbour Inc. and enjoys it alot. She loves her room mates and her 
caregiver who love her right back and lovingly call her "Lil Bit." She also loves the surrounding of the city area. She does 
not let her learning disability get in her way of living. She has a job of working for the Roosters Perch bookstore during 
the week. During her free ime you can find her catching up on her beauty sleep, walking around the neighbourhood and listening 
to music "my favourite is country music." she says.  of course you can always find her socializing and catching up with  her 
fellow roommates. At this time she doesnt have any pets here but has two dogs at her mom's house.  She does however hope to get 
a dog herself one day. One of Leanna's many talents include singing. Leanna would like all to know that she is a cancer survivor.
